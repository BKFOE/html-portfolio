<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time!</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Back To The Future</h3>
<p>Great Sci-Fi thriller about a teenager who needs to go in the past to save his future!</p>

<h3>Love Jones</h3>
<p>Classic renaissance black love movie</p>

<h3>500 Days of Summer</h3>
<p>Not your typically love movie. The exact opposite but a true representation of what it feels like to be in and out
of love!</p>
